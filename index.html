								<p>Entrepreneurship is the process of starting a business, typically a startup company offering an innovative product, process or service which provides a solution to a problem in society. The Entrepreneurship cell, KJSCE – BloomBox was conceptualized and founded in early 2012 by Hetal Doshi and three students from EXTC – Rahul Jani, Nikhil Handa and Utsav Sanghani with immense support from RIIDL, Dr. Radha Iyer, SIMSR and KJSCE leadership. Check out our <a href="#work">work</a>.</p>
